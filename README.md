Veloce Classics : 

Veloce Classics is a vintage cars rental company. 
As the founder is my roommate, I decided to give a try at web development. 

It is mere shit but it provided a good learning curve on building APIs and interacting with the server. 
Also taught me a bit of SQL throughout the process (the database is missing). 

Doubt there is something to take from this but wanted to upload it. 

(60% of the thing is AI generated don't get me wrong)
